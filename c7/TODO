- use small uniform gcpages

- write barrier for big arrays

- finalizers

- the highest_overflow_number can overflow after 2**30 non-collect-time
  minor collections

- fork() is done by copying the whole mmap non-lazily; improve.

- contention.c: when pausing: should also tell other_pseg "please commit soon"

- resharing: remap_file_pages on multiple pages at once; and madvise()
  the unused pages away --- or maybe use consecutive addresses from the
  lowest ones from segment N, instead of the page corresponding to the page
  number in segment 0 (possibly a bit messy)
