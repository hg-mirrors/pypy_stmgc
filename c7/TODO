- use small uniform gcpages

- finalizers

- the highest_overflow_number can overflow after 2**30 non-collect-time
  minor collections

- fork() is done by copying the whole mmap non-lazily; improve.

- contention.c: when pausing: should also tell other_pseg "please commit soon"

- resharing: remap_file_pages on multiple pages at once; and madvise()
  the unused pages away --- or maybe use consecutive addresses from the
  lowest ones from segment N, instead of the page corresponding to the page
  number in segment 0 (possibly a bit messy)

- possibly messy too, but think about not using N+1 segments but only N

- use a call/cc-style variant of setjmp/longjmp to avoid inevitable
  transactions when we need to return

- kill "atomic" and use regular lock elision

- increase the memory limit, currently 2.5GB; this requires, apparently,
  more fighting against LLVM bugs

- avoid __builtin_frame_address(0) in precisely the performance-critical
  functions like the interpreter main loop
