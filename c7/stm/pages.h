/* This handles pages of objects outside the nursery.  Every page
   has a "shared copy" and zero or more "private copies".

   The shared copy of a page is stored in the mmap at the file offset
   corresponding to the segment 0 offset.  Initially, accessing a page
   from segment N remaps to segment 0.  If the page is turned private,
   then we "un-remap" it to its initial location.  The 'pages_privatized'
   global array records if a page is currently mapped to segment 0
   (shared page) or to its natural location (private page).

   Note that this page manipulation logic uses remap_file_pages() to
   fully hide its execution cost behind the CPU's memory management unit.
   It should not be confused with the logic of tracking which objects
   are old-and-committed, old-but-modified, overflow objects, and so on
   (which works at the object granularity, not the page granularity).
