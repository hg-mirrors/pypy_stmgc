- fix markers (e.g. become_inevitable doesn't seem to show up)

- improve sync of small objs on commit (see FLAG_SYNC_LARGE in nursery.c)

- reshare pages:
  make seg0 MAP_SHARED in order to re-share private pages during major GC

- maybe re-implement the "please commit soon" signal

- the highest_overflow_number can overflow after 2**30 non-collect-time
  minor collections

- privatize (multiple) pages at once in the write barrier instead of
  triggering segfaults

- possibly messy too, but think about not using N+1 segments but only N

- kill "atomic" and use regular lock elision?

- increase the memory limit

- avoid __builtin_frame_address(0) in precisely the performance-critical
  functions like the interpreter main loop


---------------------------
DONE:
- non-zeroed nursery:
  read-the-docs benchmark shows 8% time spent in memset of throw_away_nursery
