/*
  We have logical pages: one %gs relative pointer can point in some
      logical page
  We have virtual pages: one virtual address can point in some
      virtual page. We have NB_SEGMENTS virtual pages per logical page.

  Each virtual page is either accessible, or PAGE_NO_ACCESS (and then
  has no underlying memory).

  TODO: one way to save memory is to re-share pages during major GC.
  The pages are mapped MAP_PRIVATE in all segments. We could use an
  extra segment that is mapped SHARED to underlying file pages so
  we can map PRIVATE pages from segments to it. The idea is that
  a major GC first validates all segments (incl. the extra seg.),
  then re-maps all PRIVATE, unmodified pages to the SHARED (unmodified)
  page. Thus, we get "free" copy-on-write supported by the kernel.
