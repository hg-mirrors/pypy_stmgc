/* Entering and leaving a "transactional code zone": a (typically very
   large) section in the code where we are running a transaction.
   This is the STM equivalent to "acquire the GIL" and "release the
   GIL", respectively.  stm_read(), stm_write(), stm_allocate(), and
   other functions should only be called from within a transaction.

   Note that transactions, in the STM sense, cover _at least_ one
   transactional code zone.  They may be longer; for example, if one
   thread does a lot of stm_enter_transactional_zone() +
   stm_become_inevitable() + stm_leave_transactional_zone(), as is
   typical in a thread that does a lot of C function calls, then we
   get only a few bigger inevitable transactions that cover the many
   short transactional zones.  This is done by having
   stm_leave_transactional_zone() turn the current transaction
   inevitable and detach it from the running thread (if there is no
   other inevitable transaction running so far).  Then
   stm_enter_transactional_zone() will try to reattach to it.  This is
   far more efficient than constantly starting and committing
   transactions.

   stm_enter_transactional_zone() and stm_leave_transactional_zone()
   preserve the value of errno.
