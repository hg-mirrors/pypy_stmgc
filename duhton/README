======
Duhton
======

A minimalistic Python-like variant.  Written in the same style as
CPython's C code (with "Du_" instead of "Py_" as a prefix to all names).

Pronounciation: "duh"-ton.

To compile, use "make".  Only tested with gcc on Linux, though it should
work on other platforms too --- but so far, it requires the gcc-only
extension "__thread".

To run the tests, you need "py.test": http://pytest.org/

There are demos: try "time duhton demo/many_square_roots.duh".

For more general information see the PAPERS file.
