Papers
======

This is a list of papers I found that describe the general idea.

* "Automatic Mutual Exclusion": the introduction paper at HotOS (may
  2007) is interesting; the rest is far too much formalism with little
  interest from my point of view.
  http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/ame/default.aspx

* "Transactions Everywhere", 2002-2003: an early reference.

* To read about the current status of STM research, which influences
  the Hardware Transactional Memory on 2013 CPUs: "NOrec: Streamlining
  STM by Abolishing Ownership Records".

* "Grace": a system using Linux's paging (virtual memory) to emulate
  an efficient STM.  Interesting idea but with probably a granularity
  that is completely wrong for us --- one page, i.e. 4KB.  Two versions
  of the same paper: http://plasma.cs.umass.edu/emery/grace  or
  http://www.cs.umass.edu/~tingy/publications/grace.ps .

* "OCM": http://ocm.dreamhosters.com/ .  A similar goal to the one here,
  but modelling cooperative multithreading with an explicit "yield".
  Also, presents two versions of Lua with different implementations
  exposing the "yield" primitive.
