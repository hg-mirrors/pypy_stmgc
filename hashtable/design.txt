Goal
======

The goal is to have dictionaries where a read-write or write-write
conflict does not cause aborts if they occur with keys that have
different 64-bit hashes.

(We might prefer the condition to be "on different keys even in case of
hash collision", but that's hard to achieve in general: for Python
dicts, "to be equal" involves calling the __eq__() method of objects.)

We distinguish between reading a value associated to a key, and only
checking that the key is in the dictionary.  It makes a difference if
a concurrent transaction writes to the value.

Some operations on a dict (particularly len() and __nonzero__()) involve
the global state of the dict, and thus cause conflict with any write
that adds or removes keys.  They should not cause conflicts with reads,
or with writes that only change existing values.

In theory, we might refine this to: a len() only conflicts with a
different transaction whose net effect is to change the length (adding 3
keys and removing 3 other keys is fine); and a __nonzero__() only
conflicts with a transaction whose net effect is to change the dict from
empty to non-empty or vice-versa.

Iterating over the keys of a dict doesn't have to conflict with other
transactions that only change existing values.  Iterating over the
values or the items conflict with other transactions doing any write at
all.


Model
=======

We can use the following idea to give a theoretical model of the
above:

Let H = {0, ... 2**64-1} be the set of possible hashes.  A dictionary is
an array of length 2**64, where each item contains a "line" of zero or
more key/value pairs.  We have STM read and write markers as follows:

* for every key/value pair, we have two markers (a read and a write) on
  the "value";

* for every line (i.e. for every possible hash value), we also have two
  markers (a read and a write) on the line itself.

Then:

* Reading or writing the value associated with an existing key accesses
  the read marker of the line, and the read or write marker of that
  particular value.

* Checking for the presence of a key only accesses the read marker of
  the line.

* Creating a new key accesses the write marker of the line (the write
  marker of the newly added value is not relevant then, because other
  transactions won't be able to access the line anyway).

* Deleting a key also accesses the write marker of the line.  (We cannot
  do it by pretending the write the value NULL, so accessing only the
  write marker of the value, because then it wouldn't conflict with
  another transaction that checks for the presence of the key by
  accessing only the read marker of the line.)

* Global operations, like getting the list of keys, work by mass-marking
  all the lines in H (all 2**64 of them, so obviously it needs to be
  special-cased in the implementation).  More precisely, len(), keys(),
  etc., sets all the lines' read markers; clear() sets all the lines'
  write markers.
