/* read/write barriers.

   - the read barrier must be applied before reading from an object.
     the result is valid as long as we're in the same transaction,
     and stm_write_barrier() is not called on the same object.

   - the write barrier must be applied before writing to an object.
     the result is valid for a shorter period of time: we have to
     do stm_write_barrier() again if we ended the transaction, or
     if we did a potential collection (e.g. stm_allocate()).

   - as an optimization, stm_repeat_read_barrier() can be used
     instead of stm_read_barrier() if the object was already
     obtained by a stm_read_barrier() in the same transaction.
     The only thing that may have occurred is that a
     stm_write_barrier() on the same object could have made it
     invalid.

   - a different optimization is to read immutable fields: in order
     to do that, use stm_immut_read_barrier(), which only activates
     on stubs.

   - stm_repeat_write_barrier() can be used on an object on which
     we already did stm_write_barrier(), but a potential collection
     can have occurred.

   - stm_write_barrier_noptr() is a slightly cheaper version of
     stm_write_barrier(), for when we are going to write
     non-gc-pointers into the object.
