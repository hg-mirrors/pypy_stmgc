/* Description of the flags
 * ------------------------
 *
 * Objects are either "young" or "old" depending on the generational garbage
 * collection: "young" objects are the ones in the nursery (plus a few big
 * ones outside) and will be collected by the following minor collection.
 *
 * Additionally, objects are either "public", "protected" or "private".
 *
 * GCFLAG_OLD is set on old objects.
 *
 * GCFLAG_VISITED is used temporarily during major collections.
 *
 * GCFLAG_PUBLIC is set on public objects.
 *
 * GCFLAG_BACKUP_COPY means the object is a (protected) backup copy.
 * For debugging.
 *
 * GCFLAG_PUBLIC_TO_PRIVATE is added to a *public* object that has got a
 * *private* copy.  It is sticky, reset only at the next major collection.
 *
 * GCFLAG_PREBUILT_ORIGINAL is only set on the original version of
 * prebuilt objects.
 *
 * GCFLAG_WRITE_BARRIER is set on *old* objects to track old-to-young
 * pointers.  It is only useful on private objects, and on protected
 * objects (which may be turned private again).  It may be left set on
 * public objects but is ignored there, because such objects are read-only.
 * The flag is removed once a write occurs and the object is recorded in
 * the list 'old_objects_to_trace'; it is set again at the next minor
 * collection.
 *
 * GCFLAG_NURSERY_MOVED is used temporarily during minor collections.
 *
 * GCFLAG_STUB is set for debugging on stub objects made by stealing or
 * by major collections.  'p_stub->h_revision' might be a value
 * that is == 2 (mod 4): in this case they point to a protected/private
 * object that belongs to the thread 'STUB_THREAD(p_stub)'.
 *
 * GCFLAG_PRIVATE_FROM_PROTECTED is set on objects that are private
 * but converted from a protected.  These are precisely the objects
 * that have a backup copy (in h_revision), which gives a copy of the
 * original protected object.
 * 
 * GCFLAG_HAS_ID is set on young objects that have an old reserved
 * memory to be copied to in minor collections (obj->h_original)
